# DialogHelper

Lightweight Android library that simplifies management of DialogFragments.

## Install

To use DialogHelper in your project, add this line to your Gradle dependencies configuration:

```gradle
implementation 'com.techyourchance:dialoghelper:0.9.0'
```

## Usage

Show an instance of MyDialogFragment (if another dialog is currently shown, it will be dismissed):

```java
mDialogHelper.showDialog(MyDialogFragment.newInstance(), null);
```

Show an instance of MyDialogFragment with a specific ID:

```java
mDialogHelper.showDialog(MyDialogFragment.newInstance(), DIALOG_ID);
```

Get the ID of the currently shown dialog:

```java
mDialogHelper.getCurrentlyShownDialogId()
```

Get the ID assigned to a dialog from within the dialog itself:

```java
mDialogHelper.getDialogId(this)
``` 

## Features

DialogHelper is "lifecycle safe". This means that if you do:

```java
mDialogHelper.showDialog(MyProgressDialogFragment.newInstance(), DIALOG_ID_SOME_FLOW_PROGRESS);
```

and then your application undergoes either configuration change or full save & restore (i.e. process death), this check will succeed afterwards:

```java
@Override
protected void onStart() {
    super.onStart();
    if (DIALOG_ID_SOME_FLOW_PROGRESS.equals(mDialogHelper.getCurrentlyShownDialogId())) {
        // check the status of the flow and dismiss the dialog if the flow has already completed
    }
}
```

You can make DialogHelper a global singleton, but you don't have to. It will function properly even if you'll create dedicated instances in each Activity, Fragment, etc.:

```java
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    mDialogHelper = new DialogHelper(getSupportFragmentManager()); // Activity-specific instance
}
```

## Important note

Due to its internal implementation details, DialogHelper will function properly only if it manages all application's dialogs (i.e. you show all the dialogs using DialogHelper). Mixing DialogHelper with other approaches might result in partial loss of functionality.

## Sample application

To get deeper insights into DialogHelper's role, you can review [sample application's source code](https://github.com/techyourchance/dialog-helper/tree/master/sample/src/main/java/com/techyourchance/dialoghelpersample).

Except for basic DialogHelper usage, this application shows some advanced design and architectural techniques that I find very useful in real Android projects. In addition, it demonstrates workarounds for quite a few limitations and bugs that I encountered over the years.
